I use conservation technology (such as acoustic sensors and camera traps), GIS, and machine learning and statistics to turn data into ecological insights about wildlife and other more-than-human relations. Previously, I was a Dangermond Fellow at the National Audubon Society, in partnership with Esri, where I made maps to protect birds and the places they need. When I’m not coding away on my computer, you can find me outside."
